/*
SUMMARY:

The WorkspaceRepo.js module is designed to serve as a data access layer for the list of workspaces from the Workspaces.json file. 
Its main task is to fetch workspace data from the local Workspaces.json file.

The `GET_WORKSPACES` function doesn't take any arguments and returns an array of workspaces. If there's an error during data retrieval 
or processing (e.g., issues with parsing the JSON), the error gets logged to the console.

INTERACTION WITH OTHER FILES:

1. Components or other modules that need the list of workspaces will import this utility function and invoke it.
2. The function's result (the list of workspaces) can then be utilized by the calling component or module for its purposes, 
   such as display or further processing.
3. Callers should correctly handle the function's output, managing potential errors and interpreting the data as needed.
